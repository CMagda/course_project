CodeBook:

Data are stored as data.frame with 14220 obs. of  5 variables:
 
 user_id 		as integer,value range <1,30>. Id of the subject(respondent).
 activity_id 		as integer, value range <1,6>. Each value indicates the type of activity. Key for merging on codebook of activity types. 
 activity Factor 	as factor with 6 levels. It describes activity types
 features  		as factor with 79 levels. It describes type of features.
 mean       		as numeric. Average of each variable for each activity and each subject.




The features were measured by the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
Values tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ are derived body linear acceleration and angular velocity.

Values tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag are magnitude 
of these three-dimensional signals and were calculated using the Euclidean norm.


Values fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag
are result of apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of these signals.
'-XYZ' denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Some mean statistics were calculated for these values:
